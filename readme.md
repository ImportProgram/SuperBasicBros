# SuperBasicBros

This was a project that I never published for a highschool class (2015-2016), where I made this wonderful project of Mario in Visual Basic. The performancewith Visual Studio 2013 (idk what .net/vb version this is) was fantastic, althoughit was running on Windows 7. For some reason Window 8, and 10 (and maybe 11?)do not seem to have the best performance...

## Building

Load the `sln` into Visual Studio (any version), at the know fact this game will likely lag. 

## License

MIT except for said images/sounds resources, those belong to you know...


Images/Sound is well, you know, not mine...
