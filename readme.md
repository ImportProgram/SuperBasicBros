# SuperBasicBros

This was a project for a sophmore high school class (2015-2016), where I made this wonderful project of Mario Bros in Visual Basic. The performanc with Visual Studio 2013 on .NET 4.5 was really decent. For some reason Window 8, and 10 (and maybe 11?) do not seem to have the best performance, but its playable!...

World 1-1 Overworld exisits only, no other worlds/levels.

## Building/Playing

Load the `SuperBasicBrows.sln` into Visual Studio (any version). 

> Visual Studio 2022 for example asks to update from 4.5 to 4.8, which is recommend. Then run said solution!

## Bugs (which will not be fixed)
- Pressing space bar when dying with duplicate game assets.
- Pressing escape doesn't pause the game
- Sometimes goobmas just kill you on head stomp
- Piranha plants just can kill you when on top of the pipes
- You **CAN NOT** make it to the top of the flag pole (its impossible)
- Probably more but I will let you find them!

## Modifying

In the `Game.vb` file, starting on like 432 (setObjects subroutine) you can add more blocks, pipes, entities, etc. Go crazy!
